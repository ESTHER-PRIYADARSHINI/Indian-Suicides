# Indian-Suicides
### In this project, I have taken a dataset which contains details about Suicides in India from 2001-2012. It has 225663 rows and 7 columns. These coulmns represent features such as age of the victim, gender, state, cause of suicides etc.
### I have sourced this dataset from Kaggle. Here is the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajanand/suicides-in-india
### I have performed an analysis on this dataset. This brings to light the demographic scenario of suicides in India.
### The results can be used to shape the government policies for suicide prevention targetted at specific states based on the most likely causes in that particular state.
